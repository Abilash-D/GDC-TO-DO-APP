# TO-DO-APP Using Restful API
We have created a restful web service and to perform CRUD operations in the form of a to-do list app where the user can create/read/update/delete various tasks. REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints and properties for creating scalable and maintainable web services. RESTful APIs allow communication 
between different systems and clients over the Internet using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. These APIs use HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the operations and use HTTP headers and response payloads to exchange information between the client and the server.
